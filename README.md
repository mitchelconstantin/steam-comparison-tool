# steam-comparison-tool

This application interacts with the Steam API to retriever user profile information based on either the user's SteamID or their vanity URL. 

As a user searches their friend's profiles, the database gets populated with all of those users games.

As the database builds up all of the games from the searched users, it also keeps a count of how many of the searched players own a game.
 
The user is shown the games that most players have in common in their libraries.
