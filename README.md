# steam-comparison-tool

# This application interacts with the Steam API to retriever user profile information based on either the user's SteamID or their vanity URL. 

# As a user searches their friend's profiles, the database gets populated with all of those users games.

# As the database builds up all of the games from the searched users, it also keeps a count of how many of the searched players own a game.
 
# The user is shown the games that most players have in common in their libraries.
